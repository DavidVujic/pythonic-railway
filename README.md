# A Pythonic Railway

This is an attempt to implement a lightweight, or perhaps sloppy, version of Railway Oriented Programming in Python.

What I'm trying to achieve with the example code in this repo, is to use the functional concepts of Railway Oriented Programming,
but still keep a Pythonic mindset.

Work in Progress ...
